# Appium

## What is Appium?

Appium is a software suite for automating testing of mobile applications. It is
developed by Sauce Labs.

## How does Appium work?

At the core of Appium is the Appium Server, which is a service which is able to
bridge the Node runtime where the Appium script is running with the automation
side where the emulated or attached application is being controlled.

Appium Desktop is a UI for Appium Server, allowing the user to start it up, shut
it down and configure its options.

Appium Inspector is a GUI for inspecting the component structure of a given
application, which assists during the automation script development process.

A library of the user's choice can be used to provider various other functions
on top of the Appium layer, such as assertions.
